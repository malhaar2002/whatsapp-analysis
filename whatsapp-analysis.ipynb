That’s also my answer for my “first” and “second” preference because I don’t know how this goddamn system works, and also as a club president, you have no right to know that. As for the ideation part, Lingua Clava is a newly-established club and I do not understand what its limits and capabilities are and what its vision is. And you’ve already seen multiple of my ideas as represented in the proposal that I drafted in the first place. You’ve known me for about six and a half years now, so know that ideation, in any case, isn’t my strongest suit. I become a part of this club and I will be the most dedicated goddamn member in the entire club, I will do all that it takes, which was also true about me for NODE last year. Also, you wanna know how serious I am about joining the club? I applied to only two clubs: NODE and Lingua Clava. I think that speaks for itself.

      "A year ago, one of my friends was participating in a Model UN based on the political aspects of the book, Harry Potter. It had the makings of an extremely fun two days, but I thought otherwise, believing it held no value to my college application or resume. Indeed, that was true.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, almost instantaneously the realisation hit me. The realisation that ‘this rebel who strived to break free from the shackles of what he deemed an oppressive educational system had inevitably succumbed to the mercy of the system’ hit me like a deer caught in the headlights. When had I become this conformist who followed the norms of doing everything solely because of the fact that it somehow advanced my career work?\n",
      "\n",
      "This sent me into a deep spiral, my beliefs were shattered, and I was analysing my behaviour and attitude towards the sheer reason why I do anything I do. I came to the conclusion that sometime along the pandemonium of 11th grade and college admissions, I unknowingly parted ways with my beloved ideology, and fell victim to convention. For the following what seemed to be an eternity, I anguished and contemplated.\n",

      "To give an example, I am rather fond of a fictional character, Kirk Gleason, from my favourite TV show. The source for this admiration stems from the fact that Kirk had the most number of professions a human being could possibly have. Yet, he performed all of them with the utmost passion and dedication, not for monetary purposes, but because he enjoyed doing them. Often the subject of ridicule because of his “odd” choice in profession, Kirk did what made him happy, and it wouldn’t hurt the rest of us to become a little more like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly believe that life has no definite purpose. We are what we make of ourselves. We choose our own life, and our purpose in this vast, expansive universe. Like in the case of Kirk, one can have fifteen thousand different purposes. There is no one singular meaning of life; it is us who define that meaning and stick to it.\n",

Basically what a framework does is that it assists with your development - for example, it can store blocks of code, preventing you from constantly rewriting it, some frameworks offer a pattern to write  code in, making the project scalar (meaning easily expandable in terms of adding more features and handling more traffic), some frameworks also help with backend etc. There are backend frameworks like Django which work for deploying the site, and basically managing everything behind the scenes (as you might be able to tell, I don’t know much about these). Then you have your frontend frameworks, like React, which help to build a scalable, responsive user interface, to put it simply. Phir each framework does diff stuff acc to your needs\n",
